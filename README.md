# EC Translation Services

This website was designed and built for my client Eleonora Corrias, a freelance Italian marketing translator.

The scope was to create a simple yet eye-catching page to that she can send to potential clients, to clearly explain the services she offers.

## Features

The page is a simple "one-pager" that consists of a navbar, five sections (hero, about, services, testimonials and contacts) and a footer, all of which can be seen in the video below.
