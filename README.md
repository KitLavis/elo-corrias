# EC Translation Services

This website was designed and built for my client Eleonora Corrias, a freelance Italian marketing translator.

The scope was to create a simple yet eye-catching page to that she can send to potential clients, to clearly explain the services she offers.

## Features

The page is a simple "one-pager" that consists of a navbar, five sections (hero, about, services, testimonials and contacts) and a footer.

- Navbar

The navbar is a dynamic element that is fixed to the top of the page, with internal links that when clicked jump to the relevant section. As the user scrolls, the background colour changes and box shadow is added to give a 3D effect. A "top" link and the client's logo are also added on scroll.
